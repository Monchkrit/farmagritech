With respect to items sold on PlantForm, we cannot confirm the price of an item until you order. Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items in our catalog may be mispriced. If the correct price of an item sold by PlantForm is higher than our stated price, the farmer will, at their discretion, either contact you for instructions before transport or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Other merchants may follow different policies in the event of a mispriced item. You are in control of your payment if you choose to use the PlantForm card service. You must verify farmer fulfillment prior to payment, or as part of the order process. Contact information is available on every item in PlantForm. If pricing and contact information is not provided please contact PlantForm and report the listing. PlantForm listings require price and contact information as part of the buyer/farmer relationship.</p>

<p>Any dispute or claim relating in any way to your use of PlantForm, or to any products or services sold or distributed by D.R.B.

The Federal Arbitration Act and federal arbitration law apply to this agreement.</p>
<p>There is no judge or jury in arbitration, and court review of an arbitration award is limited. However, an arbitrator can award on an individual basis the same damages and relief as a court (including injunctive and declaratory relief or statutory damages), and must follow the terms of these Conditions of Use as a court would.</p>
<p>We each agree that any dispute resolution proceedings will be conducted only on an individual basis and not in a class, consolidated or representative action. If for any reason a claim proceeds in court rather than in arbitration we each waive any right to a jury trial.
